<!-- ✅ Phase 1: Setup & Core Chat Functionality
Goal: Get a working chatbot that takes a medico-legal scenario and returns advice using Gemini or OpenAI.

📦 What to Do:
Create project folder/repo

Name: clingaurd-ai

Structure:

Copy
Edit
clinguard-ai/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── prompts/
├── utils/
└── README.md
Create Streamlit UI (in app.py)

Add a title + text input box

Add a button to submit the scenario

Show AI response in a clean box

Connect to OpenAI or Gemini

Use OpenAI API (gpt-3.5-turbo) or Gemini API

Use the following base prompt:

python
Copy
Edit
base_prompt = """
You are an AI medico-legal assistant trained on Indian medical law and ethics.
Given the scenario below, identify:
1. Legal issue(s)
2. Doctor’s legal and ethical duties
3. Relevant documentation/forms
4. Legal risk involved

Respond professionally, clearly, and concisely.

Scenario: {}
"""
Test with scenarios like:

"A patient with head injury refuses treatment"

"Unconscious female brought to ER by police"

"13-year-old requests abortion without parent consent" -->

<!-- ✅ At the end of Phase 1, you have a functioning legal assistant.

✅ Phase 2: Legal Corpus + RAG Setup
Goal: Make the chatbot actually smart with Indian law using RAG.

📚 What to Do:
Collect 10–15 PDF/docs:

Use links from NMC, AIIMS, WHO

Or search:

filetype:pdf site:nmc.org.in consent, filetype:pdf site:aiims.edu MLC guidelines -->

<!-- Chunk documents

Break each into ~200–400 word sections

Use langchain.document_loaders or write custom script

Embed chunks using:

python
Copy
Edit
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embeddings = model.encode(chunks)
Create FAISS index

python
Copy
Edit
import faiss
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_dim)
index.add(embeddings)
Build retrieval function:

When user submits a query:

Embed the query

Search FAISS

Pull top 3–5 chunks

Send with prompt to LLM

✅ Now your chatbot gives informed, legally grounded answers. -->

✅ Phase 3: Smart Features
Goal: Make your tool feel like a real assistant.

Add legal risk rating

Based on keywords: emergency, refusal, minor = high risk

Or use LLM to return Risk: Low / Medium / High

Suggest documentation

Use prompt logic or hardcoded suggestions

Example: “Document refusal, time, vitals, and witnesses”

Return applicable form

Consent, MLC, PM requisition, etc.

Either rule-based or embedded in doc corpus

✅ You now have an assistant doctors could genuinely use.

<!-- ✅ Phase 4: Polish, Deploy, Document
Goal: Make it beautiful and easy to showcase

Clean up UI

Add sidebar or dropdown for common scenarios

Add icons, spacing, nice fonts (Streamlit makes this easy)

Add disclaimer footer

“This tool provides AI-generated suggestions only. Not a substitute for formal legal advice.”

Deploy on Streamlit Share

streamlit deploy

Get a public link to use in your resume, LinkedIn, GitHub

Write README

What makes it different from ChatGPT or Google -->

✅ Final Resume Bullet:
Built ClinGuard AI, an AI assistant for Indian doctors to assess medico-legal scenarios using RAG and LLMs. Curated domain-specific corpus of ethics codes, case law, and medical council guidelines to provide context-aware legal duties and documentation suggestions.

✅ Optional Phase 5: Next-Level Features
Add PDF upload for MLC or case reports

Build an “Explain this section” feature for NMC rules

Quiz mode for med students

Language toggle (Hindi/English summaries)
